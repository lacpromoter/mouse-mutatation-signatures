Here there are the final data that I then used with SigProfilerMatrixGenerator 
(https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6041-2)
to get the matrices to extract signatures for each mutation type (SBSs, DBSs and IDs). 
Files are: 
I extracted signatures for SBSs, DBSs and IDs using both HDP and Sigprofiler (version)



all the initial plots were done with SigProfilerMatrixGenerator 
files for normalisation:


in SigProfilerMatrixGenerator_matrices put all the matrices
add the starting file I used to generate all the matrices
check that all the sigprofiler results are present
